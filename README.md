[Project Euler Archives](https://projecteuler.net/) is a big web repository of mathematical-computational problems. The problems are thought to be resolved using any programming language that you know as long as you can obtain the right result. 
It is an excellent resource to put in practice programming skills, computational thinking, and mathematical reasoning through the proposed list of problems. In my case, I use Python as my primary programming language and Jupyter notebooks
to implement my notes, explanations and results.
